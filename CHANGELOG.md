# Changelog

All notable changes to `dns_exporter` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added
- DNS-over-HTTP3 support: New protocol ``doh3`` was added for doing DNS-over-QUIC wrapped in HTTP3, aka DNS-over-HTTP3.
- Digestabot introduced to keep docker image digests up-to-date.

### Changed
- Bump dnspython dependency minimum version to 2.7.0
- Pass custom CA path as ssl.SSLContext for DoH2 requests to silence httpx DeprecationWarning
- Refactor verify logic into new seperate methods `get_tls_context()` and `get_tls_verify()`
- Verify that the configured `verify_certificate_path` exists in the filesystem, raise ConfigError if not.
- Improve certificate related unit tests (parametrize and add more tests)
- Move `test_internal_metrics()` test to seperate file, write metrics to temp file to ease debugging when the test breaks (which happens often).
- Update and simplify Dockerfile
- Move coverage.py, pytest and tox config to pyproject.toml.

### Fixed
- Docs url in package metadata (used for example in PyPi sidebar). Issue #11.
- Make unit tests, mypy and linters happy after DoH3 addition.
- Re-enable custom CA path support for DoQ. Only works with a CA file, not with a CA dir, for now (#132).


## [v1.0.0] - 2024-03-07

1.0.0 represents the first stable release of `dns_exporter`. Future changes (especially concerning metrics naming and labels) will follow semver rules regarding versioning. The goal is to never introduce dashboard breaking changes to metrics without bumping the major version.

The details about all the changes through the pre-releases are included below, but are probably only interesting if you have been using a pre-1.0 version. If you have existing dashboards with pre-1.0 data you will need to create new, seperate dashboards for 1.0 because the metrics have changed so much. You can use https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20617-dns-exporter/ as a starting point for your own dashboards.


## [v1.0.0-rc4] - 2024-03-06

### Changed
- Remove wrong buckets on response time Histogram, replace with default buckets


## [v1.0.0-rc3] - 2024-03-06

### Fixed
- Catch `httpx.ConnectTimeout` from protocol `doh` as failure reason `timeout`

### Changed
- Add more labels to the `dnsexp_scrape_failures_total` metric so it has all the same labels as `dnsexp_dns_query_time_seconds` in addition to the `reason` label.


## [v1.0.0-rc2] - 2024-03-06

### Fixed
- Always send Content-Length header for metrics responses
- Do not overwrite ``no_nsid`` placeholder if a blank NSID is received from server (to avoid blank labels)

### Changed
- Add the ``monitor`` label in all examples, also the ones scraping internal metrics

## [v1.0.0-rc1] - 2024-03-06

### Changed
- Minimum supported DNSPython version is now 2.5.0
- Log at level warning when encountering an unknown failure
- Remove failure reason `connection_refused` and report it as `connection_error` along with the rest of socket related errors.
- Remove `dnsexp_failures_total` from per-scrape metrics. Failure reasons are now tracked only under `/metrics`.
- Switch from `http.server.HTTPServer` to `http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer`
- Add new failure reason `invalid_response_statuscode` for DoH failures.
- The default for the ``collect_ttl_rr_value_length`` has been changed from ``255`` to ``50`` to reduce label cardinality.
- Docs: Mention the importance of scraping internal metrics under ``/metrics``
- Docs: Mention adding a ``monitor`` label to identify the exporter in use, for setups where multiple instances of ``dns_exporter`` is running.
- Update unit tests for all of the above

### Fixed
- Always send content-length header for static responses (#100, thanks @jcodybaker!)


## [v1.0.0-beta6] - 2024-03-01

### Added
- Unit tests for proxy code
- Unit tests for new code introduced to make ruff happy
- New `collect_ttl` setting to control collection of per-RR TTL metrics. Default is true.
- New `verify_certificate` bool setting to control validation of certificates on encrypted protocols. Default is true.
- New `verify_certificate_path` str setting to override the system CA when validating certificates on encrypted protocols. Leave empty to use the default system CA. Default is an empty string.

### Changed
- Replace black, flake8, isort, pydocstyle with ruff
- Some refactoring to reduce complexity and ease testing
- Much linting
- Move coverage.py config to .coveragerc to make showing measurement contexts in coverage html work
- Proxy support for DoQ disabled, pending next dnspython release with https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/pull/1060
- Improve unit tests
- Polish dockerhub action a bit (thanks @dallemon!)
- Re-add custom histogram buckets for metric `dnsexp_dns_responsetime_sedonds` from 1 second doubling until 4194304 seconds (48 days).
- Build docs in `pre-commit` to avoid breaking them
- Include `protocol`, `server`, and `proxy` labels in the `dnsexp_scrape_failures_total` Counter metric.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug which made `fail_if_all_match_regexp` validation succeed on the first matching RR (not considering further RRs).

Version 1.0.0 is a major refactor. It changes some metric names and has many internal changes. It also enables DoQ support. Most stuff should work as it did before 1.0.0 though.

The metrics exposed under /query (per-scrape metrics) are now:
- dnsexp_dns_query_time_seconds (Gauge, unchanged)
- dnsexp_dns_query_success (Gauge, unchanged)
- dnsexp_dns_response_rr_ttl_seconds (Gauge, unchanged)
- dnsexp_failures_total (Counter, renamed and changed from Enum)

The metrics exposed under /metrics (persistent exporter-internal metrics) are now:
- dnsexp_build_version (Info, unchanged)
- dnsexp_http_requests_total (Counter, unchanged)
- dnsexp_http_responses_total (Counter, unchanged)
- dnsexp_dns_queries_total (Counter, unchanged)
- dnsexp_dns_responsetime_seconds (Histogram, renamed and changed from Counter)
- dnsexp_scrape_failures_total (Counter, renamed and got a reason label)

Further changes are mostly technical details.
